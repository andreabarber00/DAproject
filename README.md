### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
### Focus on High-Performing Regions
- Expand in the West: Given its leading position in both sales and operating profit, further investment in the West region could yield significant returns. This could include opening more retail outlets, enhancing marketing efforts, or increasing the availability of high-demand products.
- Growth Opportunities in the Northeast and Southeast: These regions show substantial sales and profitability but lag behind the West. Targeted marketing campaigns, tailored product selections, and improved distribution could help increase market share.
### Optimize Product Portfolio
- Prioritize Footwear, Especially Men's Street Footwear: As the top-selling and most profitable product category, focusing on expanding the range, introducing new designs, and optimizing pricing strategies for men's street footwear could drive higher sales and margins.
- Expand Women's Apparel and Footwear: These categories also demonstrate strong sales and profitability. Developing new lines, limited editions, or collaborations could attract more customers and enhance brand loyalty.
